# 🌿 AI-Powered Automated Plant Disease Diagnosis System

This repository contains an AI-powered system designed to automatically detect plant leaf diseases from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system predicts the disease category and provides actionable recommendations including prevention tips, chemical treatments, watering suggestions, and general plant-care guidance. A Streamlit-based web application is included for real-time disease diagnosis.
